        "* Install YOLOv7 dependencies\n",

        "YOLOv7 is a single-stage object detection algorithm, meaning that it predicts bounding boxes and object classes in a single pass through the network. This makes it very fast, and it can achieve real-time inference speeds on even low-end hardware.\n",
        "\n",
        "YOLOv7 is based on the YOLOv5 architecture, but it includes a number of improvements that make it more accurate and efficient. These improvements include:\n",
        "\n",
        "A new backbone network called E-ELAN (Extended Efficient Layer Aggregation Network), which is designed to improve the feature learning capabilities of the network.\n",
        "A new neck network called CSPNet-FPN (Cross Stage Partial Networks with Feature Pyramid Network), which improves the feature fusion capabilities of the network.\n",
        "A new head network called PANet (Path Aggregation Network), which improves the detection accuracy of the network.\n",
        "YOLOv7 also introduces a number of new training techniques, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "SimSiam loss, which is a self-supervised learning loss function that helps the network to learn more robust features.\n",
        "Mosaic data augmentation, which helps to improve the generalization ability of the network.\n",
        "Label smoothing, which helps to reduce overfitting.\n",
        "As a result of these improvements, YOLOv7 achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the COCO object detection benchmark, while also being one of the fastest real-time object detectors available.\n",
